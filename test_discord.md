```

### 3.2 Listing Agents

**Command:**
```
/lab agent_list
```

**Expected output:**
- A "Lab Agents" embed listing all created agents with:
  - Agent IDs
  - Names
  - Roles
  - If no agents exist, a message saying "No agents found"

### 3.3 Updating Agents

**Command:**
```
/lab agent_update agent_id:"[Agent ID from previous list]" goal:"New research objective" expertise:"Updated expertise"
```

**Expected output:**
- An "Agent Updated" embed containing:
  - Agent ID
  - Updated fields
  - Previous and new values

### 3.4 Deleting Agents

**Command:**
```
/lab agent_delete agent_id:"[Agent ID from previous list]"
```

## 4. Team Meetings

### 4.1 Starting a Team Meeting

First, make sure you have an active session with at least a few agents.

**Command:**
```
/lab team_meeting agenda:"Discuss new approaches to protein folding prediction" rounds:3 parallel_meetings:1 live_mode:true
```

**Expected output:**
- A "Team Meeting Started" embed containing:
  - Meeting ID
  - Agenda
  - Number of rounds
  - Participating agents
  - Status: In Progress
  - Live Mode: On

If live_mode is true, you should see messages appearing in the channel as agents respond. Each message should include:

### 6.1 Running Quickstart

The quickstart command combines multiple steps (session creation, agent creation, and team meeting) into a single command.

**Command:**
```

If live_mode is true, you should see a series of messages in the channel as the agents discuss the topic, including:
1. A welcome message from the Principal Investigator
2. Introductions from each Scientist agent
3. Initial thoughts on the topic
4. Responses to each other's ideas
5. Summary or conclusions

### 6.2 Viewing Results

After the discussion completes or while it's in progress, check the transcript:

**Command:**

## Troubleshooting

If any command fails:
1. Check that the bot is online and has proper permissions
2. Verify that you have an active session when required
3. Make sure you're providing valid IDs when referencing sessions, agents, or meetings
4. Check the server logs for any error messages

## Expected Error Messages

The following are normal error responses in certain situations:

1. When trying to create an agent without an active session:
   - "You don't have an active session. Start one with `/lab start` first."

2. When trying to end a non-existent meeting:
   - "Meeting not found or already ended."

3. When providing an invalid session ID:
   - "Invalid session ID or session not found."
